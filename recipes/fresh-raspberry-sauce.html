        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This raspberry sauce is so beautiful and delicious, you and your Valentine may not even need the cake. This will absolutely work even if you use frozen raspberries, but nothing compares to the flavor of the sauce if you can somehow find and use fresh raspberries.</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds fresh raspberries</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water, or as needed (optional)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine raspberries, sugar, water, and lemon juice in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until raspberries break down, sugar dissolves, and sauce is heated through, 3 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Press sauce through a fine-mesh strainer to remove seeds. Cool to room temperature; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
